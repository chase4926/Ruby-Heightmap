# Ruby-Heightmap #
***

## Description: ##

A heightmap implementation in Ruby.


## Files: ##

-  'main.rb': A visualizer / toy that uses the HeightMap class
-  'heightmap.rb': The brain of the operation, this is all that is needed to use the HeightMap class with other projects.

## Visualizer Controls: ##

-  Pressing the **spacebar** will recalculate the height for all of the cells in the grid
-  Hold one of the **shift** keys while pressing the **spacebar** to calculate 10 generations instead of 1
-  **Z** to generate weak random static
-  **X** to generate strong random static
-  **Mouse-over** cells to see their height
-  **Left click** on a cell to recalculate that cell's height
-  **[** to lower the contrast
-  **]** to raise the contrast
